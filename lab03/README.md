# Frugal Map

Submitted by: **Peilin Chen**

## Introduction
In this lab you will implement a path finding algorithm to locate the shortest path or fastest path between two locations when given nodes and ways of different maps.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Reading Data
Create any internal representation of the specified map given, by reading the data from the given filenames
- build_internal_representation(nodes_filename, ways_filename)

## Implementation
- find_short_path(map, loc1, loc2, speed): return the shortest path between two locations
- find_fast_path(map, loc1, loc2): return the shortest path between the two locations, in terms of expected time (taking into account speed limits)
